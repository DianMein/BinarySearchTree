# Binary Search Tree in C  

This project is an implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in C.  
It supports basic operations such as:  

- Insertion of nodes  
- Deletion of nodes  
- Searching for a value  
- Traversing and printing the tree (in-order)  
- Displaying the structure of a given node  

The project also includes a simple **CMake build setup** and a **bash build script** for convenience.
